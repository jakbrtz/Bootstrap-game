# Bootstrap-game
A time-travel game where you must use the bootstrap paradox to solve puzzles

The goal of each level is to get to the flag. You can move to adjacent rooms, use keys to unlock doors, stand on pressure plates to temporarily unlock doors, and most importantly time travel.
The time machine takes you back in time to the start of the level, but it does not change your position.

Before you can start moving, you need to come up with an entire plan, then press the "run" button to see your plan in action. When you time travel you cannot change events that have already happened, but you are allowed to make a plan that involves future-you helping present-you.
